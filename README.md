# Redux - Recoded

### Article available here: 

**Zebulon** is the Typescript version that we use on our internal projects at [KBDev](https://github.com/kb-dev). It allows to type actions and reducers without passing types in the whole application.
It's not easy to use, so if you really want to use it, I can create some examples to help you. Just send me a message or create an issue on the repo.

Thanks a lot!
